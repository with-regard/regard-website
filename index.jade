        p Don't just collect data - #[a(href="#") run experiments] to get real answers.
        
        h4 Be transparent about the data you collect
        p Build trust between you and your users by showing them what you want to collect.
      
        h4 Start with questions, not data
        p We believe you should have a hypothesis before you collect any data. Our service makes you specify your assumptions up front, so you donâ€™t end up with a pile of data to decipher. 
        
        h4 Collaborate with your users to improve your product
        p We believe that developers and users should work together to improve the product. We help to start a conversation with your users, rather than spying on them.
        
        h4 Do the right thing for your users.
        p Respect your users privacy.
